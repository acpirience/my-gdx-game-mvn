# my-gdx-game-mvn

This is the basic libgdx white app produced by the gdx-setup.jar from [libgdx](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/).
The only thing changed is that it's using maven instead of gradle.

```mvn clean package``` generates a **desktop-jar-with-dependencies.jar** in **$builddir/desktop/target**
